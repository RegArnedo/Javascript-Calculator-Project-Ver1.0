# Javascript-Calculator-Project-Ver1.0
Calculator Project written in Javascript 

# Description / Story
I was thumbing through my local repo's looking for a project that had a bit of code that I wanted to cross reference.  Ended up finding this old project I put together when I first started playing with Javascript.  Decided to added to my GitHub as it's complete and that project was a great starting experience.

It was a great experience for practicing Beginner Conditional Statements and refactoring Function code.  Initially I had each of the Math operator functions with its own code function section but then practiced refaactoring the Operator code because 99.9% of it was repeated.  

This Ver 1.0 was pretty much stickign to the script of the project.  I have envisioned a Ver 2.0 where I'll build upon it by exercising coming up with ideas on my own to implment and just grinding to code it.
