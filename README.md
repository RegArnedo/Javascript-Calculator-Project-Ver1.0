# Description / Story
I was thumbing through my local repo's looking for a project that had a bit of code that I wanted to cross reference.  Found a bunch of old Javascript projects I made when I first started playing with Javascript.  Decided to add it to my GitHub as it's complete and that project was a great starting experience.  This is the first one with more to follow.  

It was a great experience for practicing Beginner Conditional Statements and refactoring Function code.  Initially I had each of the Math operator functions with its own code function section but then practiced refaactoring the Operator code because 99.9% of it was repeated.  

Ver 1.0 was a learning project adhering to the script for learning purposes.  Ver 2.0 wil lbe where I'll build upon it by exercising coming up with ideas on my own to implment and just grinding to code it.
